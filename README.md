## Guidelines and Best Practice

### Project specific guidelines.

### General Guidelines
1. People before code: If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.
2. Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors section.
3. Reference the issue numbers in the PR.
4. Make a note to add relevent Screen Shots when you make a PR.
5.  Pull Request older than 3 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.
6.  Do not make PR which is not related to any issues.
7.  Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.
8.  Be polite: Be polite to other community members.

Happy Coding!
